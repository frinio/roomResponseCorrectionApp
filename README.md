# roomResponseCorrectionApp

The **roomResponseCorrectionApp** is a small application about the equalization of acoustic responses using and combining the techniques of complex smoothing and pole-fitting, aiming for both magnitude and phase correction. Even though its name suggests only the equalization of room responses, it can be used for any acoustic impulse response.
 
This application is the result of my master's thesis. Information about the algorithms used in this app can be found in the following links:

* Pole-Fitting: [3](http://home.mit.bme.hu/~bank/parfilt/) theory and Matlab code

### Videos

Here is a [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mqptffu6t8hdaik/AACR8bU9Agc1pgSMEpgMf9MUa?dl=0) to a couple of videos I used in my thesis' presentation. They demonstrate two ways with which the user can place the poles used in the pole-fitting method. Start with the video that shows the 'Perceptual' way and then move to the 'Graphical'.
