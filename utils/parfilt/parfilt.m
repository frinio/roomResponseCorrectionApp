%PARFILT filtering by parallel second-order sections.
%   Y=PARFILT(Bm,Am,FIRcoeff,X) filters the signal X by the parallel
%   second-order sections given in the matrices Bm and Am. Additionally, X
%   is filtered by an FIR filter given by FIRcoeff, and this is also added
%   to the output. If there is no parallel FIR part (not even a simple
%   coefficient), then use FIRcoeff=0 as a parameter.
%
%   The Bm and Am matrices are containing the [b0 b1]' and [1 a0 a1]'
%   coefficients for the different sections in their columns. For example,
%   Bm(:,3) gives the [b0 b1]' parameters of the third second-order
%   section. The parallel second-order sections can be designed by the
%   PARFILTDES command.
